Wario Waft (UpB)
Fixed a glitch where he would not gain any height with this move if hit by a windbox

Cratestipation
Wario will now let go of whatever item he was holding when spawning the crate. The item will be placed next to him on the crate. 
This fixes a bug where the crate would not spawn if Wario was holding an item when using this move.
