Green missile:
	- Nerfed first hitbox knockback a bit.
	
	- Added 2 secondary hitboxes to the move. Now has 3 total, descending in power. 
	While the first hitbox is really strong, the second and third are incrementally weaker.
	the second hitbox comes out frame 24, and the last comes out on frame 36. there is only
	ever 1 hitbox active, the others are removed before the others come out

	- Now loses most of his momentum if he connects with a shielding opponent.
	
Super Jump Punch
	-nerfed standard hitbox a bit, killing off the top at anything about 60 was a bit much for luigi's damage output and air to ground transition. (shoryuken hitbox untouched)

TIME HAS STOPPED!
Welcome to MINUS WORLD.
Everything but Luigi is now completely frozen in time.
His foes cannot escape anything coming to them.
They won’t even realize they’ve been KO’d.
Time flows again.
