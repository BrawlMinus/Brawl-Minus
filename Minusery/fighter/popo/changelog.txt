Nana
Can only die when not in hitstun

Belay
Solo upwards initial velocity 1.9 -> 2.8

Squall Hammer
Nana snap distance 30 -> (basically) infinite
Initial solo grounded velocity reduction 25%/10% -> 0%
Gravity .1 -> .065
Max downwards velocity 2.8 -> 1.8
Mash window 6 -> 8
Mash boost .6/.8 -> .8/.9
Aerial solo initial vertical velocity boost  .6 -> 1.2
Grounded acceleration .09 -> .1
Grounded max horizontal velocity 1.1 -> 1.3
Aerial acceleration .08 -> .09
Aerial max horizontal velocity 1.3 -> 1.5
Synced wall bounce momentum conservation .75 -> .5
Can grab ledge after frame 12/13

tl;dr version: Nana will teleport to Popo at the start of squall hammer similarly to belay and Squall Hammer generally moves slightly faster and is more responsive


Grabs
Nana can now grab again
All of Nana's throws freeze foes to prevent infinites
